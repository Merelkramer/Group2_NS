## Data Preparation

Includes the cleaning and merging of all the necessary data sets inclundig:
- NS Operational Data
- NS Disruption Data
- Weather Data

Also includes the data prepocessing conducted to create the necessary variables used for the ML Models.

## Data Vizualisations

Includes the data exploration and the figures and charts generated to visualize and understand it for later interpretation. 
Additionally, it includes the visualization of the results obtained from the ML models.

### File: DataViz.ipynb

## Machine Learning model 

Implementation of the machine learning models, including feature selection, model training, model tuning, model evaluation metrics, and comparison between them and against the NS predictions. It also includes the determination and visualization of the importance of the features used.
